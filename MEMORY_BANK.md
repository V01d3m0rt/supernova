- [ ] Add error handling for edge cases in animation display
- [ ] Consider adding a way to disable animations for users who prefer simpler output
- [ ] Improve error handling in LLM provider for different response formats
- [ ] Add better debugging information for LLM provider errors
- [ ] Fix color rendering issues with [green] tags not displaying properly

## Notes

- The thinking and generating animations are now synchronized with the actual LLM processing
- The thinking animation shows while waiting for the LLM to start responding
- The generating animation shows briefly when the LLM starts streaming its response
- Both animations use Rich's Live display for smooth, in-place updates
- All streaming state variables are now properly initialized in the ChatSession constructor
- Streaming state variables are reset at the beginning of each chat loop iteration
- Fixed the LLM provider to handle streaming responses properly without JSON serialization errors
- Improved chunk handling to be more robust against different response formats
- Added a fallback mechanism to use non-streaming mode when streaming fails
- Created a dedicated StreamProcessor class to handle streaming responses
- Added better error handling and logging for streaming issues
- Fixed duplicate user input display by removing redundant display_response call
